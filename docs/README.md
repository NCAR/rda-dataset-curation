# rda-dataset-curation
Provides generic tools for data curation as well as dataset specific curation software.


`common/`

This directory will have self-contained scripts that may help the curation process. If possible they should allow command line acces and progromatic access.


`test/`

Test scripts for the curation methods. Also contains convenience scripts for testing.

`datasets/` 

Dataset specific workflows. Try to use the common scripts where possible. If functionality doesn't seem to be there, then feel free to add it, or create an issue if you don't think you're the right person for the job.
